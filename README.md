unity-achievements
==================

A little achievements plugin for the Unity editor.

How to use
----------

Just copy the files from the 'Editor' folder into an 'Editor' folder in your project.

You can see all the achievements - both those you've unlocked, and those you haven't - via the Preferences window.

Adding your own achievements
----------------------------

The system is modular and designed to have new achievements plugged into it, written by other people. Look at DemoAchievements.cs for examples.
